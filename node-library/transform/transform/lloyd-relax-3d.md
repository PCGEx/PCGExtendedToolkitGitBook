# Lloyd Relax 3D

### Overview

Lloyd Relax 3D iteratively moves points toward more uniform spacing using Voronoi-based relaxation. Each iteration computes a 3D Voronoi diagram, then moves each point toward the centroid of its Voronoi cell. This gradually distributes points more evenly throughout their volume while respecting the overall shape of the point cloud.

### How It Works

1. **Voronoi Computation**: Builds a 3D Voronoi diagram from the current point positions.
2. **Centroid Calculation**: For each point, calculates the centroid of its Voronoi cell.
3. **Position Update**: Moves each point toward its cell centroid, scaled by the influence factor.
4. **Iteration**: Repeats the process for the specified number of iterations.

**Usage Notes**

* **Convergence**: More iterations produce more uniform spacing, but with diminishing returns. Typically 5-20 iterations is sufficient.
* **Boundary Behavior**: Points near the boundary of the point cloud tend to move inward over iterations, potentially shrinking the overall volume slightly.
* **Progressive Influence**: When enabled, the influence factor increases across iterations, starting gentle and becoming stronger toward the end.

### Behavior

```
Initial Points:              After Lloyd Relax (5 iterations):

  ●  ●●                        ●     ●
     ●                    →         ●
  ●     ●●                     ●     ●
                                  ●

### Settings

#### Node-Specific Settings

<details>

<summary><strong>Iterations</strong> <code>int32</code></summary>

Number of relaxation iterations to perform. More iterations produce more uniform spacing, but with diminishing returns after a certain point.

Default: `5`

| **Influence Input**       | `EPCGExInputValueType` | `Constant` | Whether to use a constant value or read from an attribute                                      |
| **Influence**             | `double`               | `1.0`      | How much each point moves toward its centroid (0 = no movement, 1 = full movement to centroid) |
| **Progressive Influence** | `bool`                 | `true`     | When enabled, influence starts low and increases each iteration, creating smoother convergence |
