# Clipper2 : Rect Clip

### Overview

This node clips paths against an axis-aligned bounding box using Clipper2's optimized rectangle clipping algorithm. It is significantly faster than using boolean intersection with a rectangle shape. The clipping bounds can be derived from operand data bounds or specified manually, with optional padding adjustments.

> This is a [clipper2-processor.md](../common-settings/clipper2-processor.md "mention")

### How It Works

1. **Determine Clip Rectangle**: Computes the clipping rectangle from either operand bounds or manual specification.
2. **Apply Padding**: Optionally expands or contracts the rectangle by the padding amount.
3. **Project to 2D**: Input paths are projected onto a 2D plane (only X and Y are used after projection).
4. **Clip Paths**: Uses Clipper2's RectClip64 algorithm for polygons or RectClipLines64 for open paths.
5. **Unproject Results**: Clipped paths are transformed back to 3D space with interpolated attributes.

**Usage Notes**

* **AABB Only**: This node works exclusively with axis-aligned bounding boxes. For arbitrary polygon clipping, use the Boolean node with Intersection operation.
* **Performance**: RectClip is optimized specifically for rectangle clipping and is much faster than general boolean operations for this use case.
* **Invert Clip**: When inverted, the operation keeps portions of paths outside the rectangle (using boolean difference internally).
* **Open Paths as Lines**: When enabled, open paths are clipped as line segments, preserving their open state. When disabled, they're treated as closed polygons.

### Behavior

```
Rect Clip Operation:

Input Path        Clip Rectangle     Result
    ╭───╮            ┌─────┐          ┌─╮
   ╱     ╲           │     │          │ │

  ╲       ╱          │     │          │ │
   ╲     ╱           └─────┘          └─╯

#### Node-Specific Settings

<details>

<summary><strong>Projection Details</strong> <code>FPCGExGeo2DProjectionDetails</code></summary>

Controls how 3D paths are projected to 2D for clipping. Note that only X and Y coordinates are used after projection.

//→ See TODO FPCGExGeo2DProjectionDetails

#### Clip Bounds Settings

<details>

<summary><strong>Bounds Source</strong> <code>EPCGExRectClipBoundsSource</code></summary>

Determines where the clipping rectangle bounds come from.

| Option             | Description                                                             |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Operand Bounds** | Uses the combined bounding box of all operand spatial data in the group |
| **Manual**         | Uses manually specified rectangle bounds                                |

Default: `Operand Bounds`

⚡ PCG Overridable

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Manual Bounds</strong> <code>FBox</code></summary>

The clipping rectangle bounds in world space. Only X and Y dimensions are used after projection to 2D.

Default: `(-100, -100, -100)` to `(100, 100, 100)`

📋 _Visible when Bounds Source = Manual_

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Bounds Padding</strong> <code>double</code></summary>

Uniform padding to apply to the clipping bounds. Positive values expand the rectangle, negative values shrink it.

Default: `0.0`

⚡ PCG Overridable

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Bounds Padding Scale</strong> <code>FVector2D</code></summary>

Per-axis multipliers for the padding. Allows non-uniform padding by scaling the X and Y padding independently.

Default: `(1.0, 1.0)`

⚡ PCG Overridable

</details>

#### Tweaks Settings

<details>

<summary><strong>Clip Open Paths As Lines</strong> <code>bool</code></summary>

When enabled, open paths are clipped using line-segment clipping, preserving their open state. When disabled, open paths are treated as closed polygons for clipping purposes.

Default: `true`

📋 _Visible when Skip Open Paths is disabled_

⚡ PCG Overridable

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Clip As Lines</strong> <code>bool</code></summary>

When enabled, clips closed paths as line segments instead of polygons. The output will be open paths representing the portions of the original path edges that fall within the rectangle.

Default: `false`

📋 _Visible when Invert Clip is disabled_

⚡ PCG Overridable

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Invert Clip</strong> <code>bool</code></summary>

When enabled, inverts the clipping operation to keep portions of paths outside the rectangle. Internally uses boolean difference with the rectangle.

Default: `false`

⚡ PCG Overridable
