# Sampler : Test Neighbors

### Overview

This sub-node creates a sampler that tests neighbors against connected filters and outputs statistics about how many pass or fail. Rather than blending attribute values, this sampler counts and weighs filter results, enabling analysis of neighborhood characteristics. Results can be written as raw counts, normalized ratios, or weighted sums.

### How It Works

1. **Connect Filters**: Attach filter sub-nodes defining the test criteria
2. **Configure Outputs**: Choose which statistics to write (inside/outside counts, weights)
3. **Execute Sampling**: Each neighbor is tested against filters during traversal
4. **Accumulate Results**: Track pass/fail counts and weights per vertex
5. **Write Attributes**: Output final statistics to vertex attributes

**Usage Notes**

* **Normalization**: Normalized values divide by total count or weight, giving ratios between 0-1 regardless of neighbor count.
* **Weighted Results**: Weight-based outputs account for distance or index-based weighting from the sampling configuration.

### Behavior

```
Filter Testing Example:

Vertex A with neighbors B, C, D, E:
  Filter: "Health > 50"

  B.Health = 80 → PASS (weight 1.0)
  C.Health = 30 → FAIL (weight 0.8)
  D.Health = 60 → PASS (weight 0.6)
  E.Health = 40 → FAIL (weight 0.4)

Results written to A:
  InsideNum = 2        (B, D passed)
  OutsideNum = 2       (C, E failed)
  TotalNum = 4

  InsideWeight = 1.6   (1.0 + 0.6)
  OutsideWeight = 1.2  (0.8 + 0.4)
  TotalWeight = 2.8

Normalized versions:
  InsideNum (normalized) = 0.5    (2/4)
  InsideWeight (normalized) = 0.57 (1.6/2.8)
```
