# Edge Filter : Edge Direction

### Overview

This edge filter computes the direction of each edge and compares it against a reference direction. The comparison can be performed using either dot product (for angular similarity) or hash (for exact direction matching). This allows you to filter edges based on orientation — for example, keeping only edges that point upward, removing horizontal connections, or selecting edges aligned with a specific axis.

> This is a [filter-definition](../common-settings/filter-definition/ "mention")

### How It Works

1. **Direction Computation**: Computes the direction vector of each edge from start to end vertex.
2. **Reference Direction**: Gets the comparison direction from either a constant or a vertex attribute.
3. **Direction Comparison**: Compares the edge direction against the reference using either dot product or hash comparison.
4. **Result**: The edge passes or fails based on the comparison result and invert setting.

**Usage Notes**

* **Dot Comparison**: Uses the dot product to measure angular similarity between directions.
* **Hash Comparison**: Uses vector hashing for faster but exact direction matching.
* **Transform Direction**: Optionally transforms the reference direction by the vertex's local transform.
* **Invert Direction**: Can flip the reference direction before comparison.

### Behavior

```
Direction Examples (Reference = Up Vector):

Dot Product Mode:
  Edge pointing up    → High dot (≈1.0) → PASS
  Edge pointing down  → Low dot (≈-1.0) → FAIL
  Edge horizontal     → Zero dot (≈0.0) → depends on threshold

Hash Mode:
  Edge exactly up     → Hash matches → PASS
  Edge slightly off   → Hash differs → FAIL
```
