# Edge Filter : Endpoints Check

### Overview

This edge filter evaluates the start and/or end vertices of each edge against connected point filters, then determines the edge's filter result based on the configured mode. This allows you to filter edges based on vertex properties — for example, keeping only edges where both endpoints have a certain attribute value, or edges connecting vertices of different types.

> This is a [filter-definition](../common-settings/filter-definition/ "mention")

### How It Works

1. **Endpoint Evaluation**: Applies the connected point filters to both the start and end vertices of each edge.
2. **Mode Check**: Based on the selected mode, determines if the edge passes:
   * **None**: Neither endpoint passes the filters
   * **Both**: Both endpoints must pass
   * **Any**: At least one endpoint passes
   * **Start/End**: Specific endpoint must pass
   * **SeeSaw**: One must pass and the other must fail
3. **Result Comparison**: Compares the outcome against the expected result.
4. **Final Result**: Returns pass/fail based on the comparison and invert setting.

**Usage Notes**

* **Requires Point Filters**: Connect point filter providers to define the endpoint checks.
* **Directional Modes**: Start/End modes are affected by edge direction settings on the parent node.
* **SeeSaw Mode**: Useful for finding edges that connect different types of vertices.

### Behavior

```
Mode Examples:

Both (Expects Pass):          Any (Expects Pass):
  [✓]---[✓] → PASS              [✓]---[✗] → PASS
  [✓]---[✗] → FAIL              [✗]---[✗] → FAIL

SeeSaw:                       None (Expects Pass):
  [✓]---[✗] → PASS              [✗]---[✗] → PASS
  [✓]---[✓] → FAIL              [✓]---[✗] → FAIL
```

### Settings

<details>

<summary><strong>Mode</strong> <code>EPCGExEdgeEndpointsCheckMode</code></summary>

Determines how endpoint filter results are combined to produce the edge filter result.

| Option     | Description                                    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **None**   | Neither endpoint must pass the filters         |
| **Both**   | Both endpoints must pass the filters           |
| **Any**    | At least one endpoint must pass                |
| **Start**  | The edge's start endpoint must pass            |
| **End**    | The edge's end endpoint must pass              |
| **SeeSaw** | One endpoint must pass and the other must fail |

Default: `Both`
