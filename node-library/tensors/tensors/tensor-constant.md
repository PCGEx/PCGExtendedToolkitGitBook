# Tensor : Constant

### Overview

The Constant Tensor provides a uniform direction throughout the entire field. Unlike other tensors that vary based on position or distance to sources, this tensor returns the same direction vector everywhere. It serves as a baseline or fallback direction and ensures that tensor sampling always succeeds, even in regions where other tensors have no influence.

### How It Works

1. **Direction Setup**: Stores the configured constant direction vector.
2. **Uniform Sampling**: Returns the same direction for all sample positions regardless of location.
3. **Weight Application**: Applies the tensor weight and potency to control its influence when combined with other tensors.
4. **Fallback Guarantee**: Ensures sampling never fails, providing a default direction when other tensors contribute zero influence.

**Usage Notes**

* **Fallback Direction**: When combined with spatial tensors, provides a default direction in regions where other tensors have no effect.
* **Sampling Safety**: This tensor guarantees that sampling will never fail due to zero tensor influence, which can prevent extrusion from stopping unexpectedly.
* **Combination**: Often used as a background field that other tensors modify locally.
