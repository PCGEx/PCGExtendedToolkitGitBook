# Find Cluster Hull

### Overview

This node extracts the outermost boundary of each cluster graph as a closed path. Unlike Find All Cells which discovers every internal cell, this node outputs only the single hull contour that wraps the entire cluster. This is useful for obtaining the silhouette or perimeter of a cluster structure.

### How It Works

1. **Find Boundary**: Identifies the outermost edges that form the cluster perimeter.
2. **Trace Hull**: Follows the boundary edges to build a closed contour path.
3. **Apply Constraints**: Validates the hull against size and shape constraints.
4. **Output Path**: Creates path data representing the hull contour.

**Usage Notes**

* **Single Output Per Cluster**: Each cluster produces exactly one hull path.
* **Concave Hulls**: The hull follows the actual cluster boundary, not a convex hull.
* **Winding Order**: Output can be forced to clockwise or counter-clockwise orientation.
* **Disconnected Clusters**: Each connected component produces its own hull.

### Behavior

```
Hull Extraction:

Cluster Graph:
    [A]───[B]───[C]
     │ ╲ ╱ │ ╲ ╱ │
    [D]───[E]───[F]
     │ ╱ ╲ │ ╱ ╲ │
    [G]───[H]───[I]

Hull Output (outer boundary only):
    A → B → C → F → I → H → G → D → A

Internal edges (B-E, E-H, D-E, E-F, etc.) are not part of hull
```
